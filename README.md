# Study Timer App

This is a simple Study Timer App built in Python.

## How It Works
- You enter how many minutes you want to study.
- The app waits during your study time.
- After study time, it alerts you to take a 10-minute break.
- After the break, it congratulates you!

## Files
- `final project.py` - the Python code.
- `videoXXXXXXXX.mp4` - video demo of the app working.

## Video Demonstration
